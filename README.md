**Title**: Pilot Exploration Chatroom Study

**Note on files**: 
* The *Sample_Visualizations* file creates visuals of the networks from finalExplorationChatroom and finalExploitation chatroom. To create both networks, replace the file name within the code at the start of the script. The Chatroom_ABM files contain simulations of the original pilot study within python (.py) and jupiter notebook (.ipynb). 

* The *PrePostWrangling* file takes the raw data and (1) combines the pre and post experiement data from qualtrics from both groups, (2) combines the chatroom data from both groups into 1 file, and (3) combines the qualtrics with the chatroom data.
